This directory contains further documentation.

Some of the files contain `TeX` code and therefore need to be generated. So if you want to edit a markdown file that has a `.raw` counterpart, please edit the `raw` one and call `doc/gendocs.sh` from the project root. This will (re)generate the corresponding `.md` file. Please make sure to always commit both files.

Note that you have to follow [this](https://github.com/leegao/readme2tex#installation) installation instructions first.
